# Cluster Tester - Complete Setup Guide

This repository contains a collection of microservices and a Kubernetes operator for deploying and managing them. All services have been instrumented with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation and configured for Backstage.io API registration.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The repository contains:
- **6 Microservices**: coffee-shop, pet-store, restaurant, college-admission, electronics-store, electronics-store-tracing
- **Kubernetes Operator**: cluster-operator (manages deployment of all services)
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger integration for all services
- **Service Discovery**: Backstage.io catalog integration

## üìã Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (for operator deployment)
- kubectl configured
- PowerShell 5.1+ (Windows) or PowerShell Core 7+ (cross-platform)
- (Optional) kubebuilder for operator development
- (Optional) curl or use built-in `Invoke-RestMethod` for API testing

### Windows-Specific Setup

1. **Install Go**: Download from https://golang.org/dl/
2. **Install Docker Desktop**: Download from https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop
3. **Install kubectl**: 
   ```powershell
   # Using chocolatey
   choco install kubernetes-cli
   # or using winget
   winget install Kubernetes.kubectl
   ```
4. **Install swag for documentation generation**:
   ```powershell
   go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
   ```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

Use the provided PowerShell scripts for automated setup and validation:

```powershell
# Validate your environment and dependencies
.\validate-setup.ps1

# Build all services with documentation and tests
.\build-all.ps1 -GenerateDocs -RunTests -BuildImages

# For operator development
.\build-all.ps1 -BuildOperator
```

### Manual Setup

### 1. Generate API Documentation

```powershell
# Generate Swagger docs for all services
.\generate-docs.bat  # Windows (PowerShell)
# or for cross-platform:
# .\generate-docs.sh  # Linux/Mac (if using WSL)
```

### 2. Build and Test Individual Services

Each service can be built and tested independently:

```powershell
cd coffee-shop
go build -o bin/coffee-shop.exe main.go
.\bin\coffee-shop.exe  # Service runs on port 8080

# Test endpoints (using curl or Invoke-RestMethod)
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# or
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/health"

# Open Swagger UI in browser
Start-Process "http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html"
```

### 3. Deploy with Kubernetes Operator

```powershell
cd cluster-operator

# Build the operator
make build

# Deploy CRDs and operator to cluster
make deploy

# Create a cluster deployment
kubectl apply -f config/samples/cluster_v1_clustertester.yaml
```

## üìä Service Endpoints

All services expose the following standard endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/health` | Health check endpoint |
| `/swagger/index.html` | Swagger UI documentation |
| `/swagger/doc.json` | OpenAPI JSON spec |

## üéØ Backstage.io Integration

### Service Registration

Each service includes a `catalog-info.yaml` file for Backstage registration:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: API
metadata:
  name: coffee-shop-api
  description: Coffee Shop API for ordering beverages
spec:
  type: openapi
  lifecycle: production
  owner: platform-team
  definition:
    $text: http://localhost:8080/swagger/doc.json
```

### Bulk Registration

Import all services at once using the root catalog file:

```
https://github.com/cdcent/cluster-tester/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml
```

## üîß Kubernetes Operator

The cluster-operator provides declarative management of all services:

### Custom Resource Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.cdcent.io/v1
kind: ClusterTester
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  services:
    coffeeShop:
      enabled: true
      replicas: 2
    petStore:
      enabled: true
      replicas: 1
    # ... other services
  database:
    enabled: true
    type: mysql
  global:
    namespace: cluster-tester
    imageRegistry: "your-registry.com"
```

### Operator Commands

```powershell
# Build operator
make build

# Run locally (development)
make run

# Build and push Docker image
make docker-build docker-push IMG=your-registry/cluster-operator:tag

# Deploy to cluster
make deploy IMG=your-registry/cluster-operator:tag

# Undeploy
make undeploy

# Run tests
make test
```

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests

Each service includes unit tests:

```powershell
cd coffee-shop
go test ./tests/...
```

### Integration Testing

Use the provided test files to validate service functionality:

```powershell
# Test all services using PowerShell
$services = @("coffee-shop", "pet-store", "restaurant", "college-admission", "electronics-store", "electronics-store-tracing")
foreach ($service in $services) {
    Write-Host "Testing $service..."
    Set-Location $service
    go test ./tests/...
    Set-Location ..
}
```

### Operator Testing

```powershell
cd cluster-operator
make test
```

## üê≥ Docker Support

Each service includes a Dockerfile for containerization:

```powershell
# Build service image
cd coffee-shop
docker build -t coffee-shop:latest .

# Build operator image
cd cluster-operator
make docker-build IMG=cluster-operator:latest
```

## üîç Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks

All services expose `/health` endpoints that return:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "service": "coffee-shop"
}
```

### Swagger Documentation

Access interactive API documentation at `/swagger/index.html` for each service.

### Tracing (Electronics Store Tracing)

The electronics-store-tracing service includes distributed tracing capabilities for monitoring request flows.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service won't start**: Check port availability and Go version
   ```powershell
   # Check if port is in use
   Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   # Check Go version
   go version
   ```

2. **Swagger docs not generating**: Ensure swag is installed
   ```powershell
   go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
   # Verify installation
   swag --version
   ```

3. **Operator deployment fails**: Verify RBAC permissions and CRD installation
   ```powershell
   kubectl get crd clustertesters.cluster.cdcent.io
   kubectl auth can-i create clustertesters --as=system:serviceaccount:cluster-tester-system:cluster-tester-controller-manager
   ```

4. **Database connection issues**: Check MySQL deployment and connection strings
   ```powershell
   kubectl get pods -n cluster-tester -l app=mysql
   kubectl logs -n cluster-tester deployment/mysql
   ```

5. **Windows file path issues**: Use PowerShell's path handling
   ```powershell
   # Use Join-Path for cross-platform compatibility
   $binaryPath = Join-Path "bin" "coffee-shop.exe"
   ```

### Debug Commands

```powershell
# Check operator logs
kubectl logs -n cluster-tester-system deployment/cluster-tester-controller-manager

# Check service pods
kubectl get pods -n cluster-tester

# Check CRD status
kubectl get clustertesters -A

# Check Windows-specific issues
Get-Process -Name "*coffee*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## ü§ù Contributing
